About Lance

Lance is a professional Scala adventurer, open source loner, longevity nut and semi-regular awkward dancer. Lance has been 
exploring Scala for the last 6 years and recently renewed his Scala vows on his Scala-versary: 
"I'll never quit you... not like those others". Lance enjoys polishing his shiny sword of functional programming +2 but 
finds his patrons prefer just "getting things done" with their rusty daggers. Lance also used to do a lot of improv, has 
deep thoughts about one-handed typing and will win, eventually, by living longer than everyone else.
